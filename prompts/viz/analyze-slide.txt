Analyze the following slide content and determine if it would benefit from visual enhancement with an image.

# Slide Content
{slide_content}

# Analysis Criteria
A slide is a good candidate for visualization if it:
- Contains only text bullets without any existing images
- Describes a concept that can be visually represented
- Would be more engaging with a supporting image
- Has content that can be illustrated (processes, comparisons, metaphors, etc.)

# Instructions
1. Analyze whether this slide would benefit from an image
2. If yes, describe what type of image would best support the content
3. Suggest where the image should be placed (left/right column in 2-column layout)
4. Provide a brief description for image generation

# Output Format
Respond with a JSON object:
{{
  "needs_image": true/false,
  "image_type": "photograph|illustration|diagram|icon|chart",
  "image_description": "detailed description for image generation",
  "image_position": "left|right",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of why this image would help"
}}

If needs_image is false, only include needs_image and reasoning fields.
